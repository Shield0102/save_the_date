The flag is the phone number of this very Marks & Spencer store.2nd part of the flag is
```01743232552```

6. 3rd part of the flag: The riddle/description for the 3rd part of flag mentions  12th of february as a new beginning which may imply a new record being made as the next part of the riddle directly points toward the sport of ice-hockey along with a few lines which imply that someone lost a match when this record was made. The record was made on 12th of february and when looked up on the internet, one can find the NHL record being broken by Wayne Gretzky.
